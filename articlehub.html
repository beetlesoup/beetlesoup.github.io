    <div class="jarticlebox">
      <p>Nicknamed 'ghost particles,' the elusive neutrinos have been around since the beginning of the universe, appearing in three 'flavors' named for the particle they produce upon interacting with matter: electrons, muons, and taus. The sun serves as a massive nuclear reactor emitting torrents of electron neutrinos, but experiments detected roughly a third as many electron neutrinos radiating from the sun as expected. Some researchers began to suspect that the solar neutrinos were oscillating, or switching flavors, en route to Earth.</p>
      <p><mark>Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald spearheaded giant underground experiments that revealed that individual neutrinos do oscillate from one flavor into another, and that they have mass.</mark></p>
      <blockquote>Kajita and his Super-Kamiokande collaborators focused on detecting muon neutrinos that are produced in the atmosphere when incoming charged particles from space collide with air molecules. The researchers counted up the rare flashes due to neutrino interactions and charted where each neutrino had come from. More muon neutrinos came from above than below, even though they pass unaffected through the Earth. In 1998, the team concluded that the neutrinos from below had enough time during their trek through Earth's interior to change flavors, while the ones from above did not (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ghostlike-particles-carry-little-weight">SN: 6/13/98, p. 374</a>). While Super-Kamiokande produced compelling evidence for neutrino oscillation, the experiment couldn't prove that the total number of neutrinos, regardless of flavor, was consistent.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>In 2001 and 2002, McDonald's team confirmed the scarcity of electron neutrinos from the sun but showed that the shortage disappeared if one took into account neutrinos of all flavors (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-bedrock-cracks-sun-shines">SN: 6/23/01, p. 388</a>).</blockquote>
      <p>These discoveries led to more research on the three neutrino flavors. <mark>A few recent experiments suggest that the oscillation rate of neutrinos may differ from the oscillation rate of anti-neutrinos</mark>, which could help explain why the universe is dominated by matter, even though it probably started out with equal parts matter and anti-matter.</p>

                  <mark>Unlike us, specific regions of an octopus' motor cortex don't correspond to specific parts of its body. Instead, each region controls different parts at different times.</mark> Their motor neural network seems as flexible as their bodies ‚Äî a phenomenon that expands the range of neurophysiological possibility, and could refine the design of arm-flexing robots.
                  </p></blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>How octopuses control their arms has been a focus of [University of Jerusalem neurobiologist Benny] Hochner's work for more than a decade. In earlier studies, he helped show that seemingly complex movements are actually combinations of individually simple motions. Hochner also found that many of the movements are guided peripherally, rather than by the brain, as if each arm had its own spinal cord.</p>
                    <p>An octopus brain sends a general prompt, and the arm computes the specifics: It's much simpler than running all those calculations in the brain itself. And all this is especially interesting to roboticists who want to build machines with flexible appendages, ideal for rescue bots working in disaster areas or surgical machines weaving through a body.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <blockquote><p>"The networks are embedded in one another. The system is remodeled according to stimulation. It's more dynamic, rather than strictly organized," said Hochner.</p><p>Hochner suspects that other neurological programs, stored elsewhere in the octopuses' bodies ‚Äî perhaps at the base of each arm ‚Äî act as gates, blocking signals from the brain or allowing them to pass.</p></blockquote>
