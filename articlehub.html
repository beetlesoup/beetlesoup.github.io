       <strong>JWST's Puzzling Early Galaxies Don't Break Cosmology‚ÄîBut They Do Bend Astrophysics</strong> - 
            Jonathan O'Callaghan on Scientific American<br>
            <a class="date" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jwsts-puzzling-early-galaxies-dont-break-cosmology-but-they-do-bend-astrophysics/">üî≠ 2024 Feb 9</a>
    <div class="jarticlebox">
          <p>Ever since it opened its giant infrared eye on the cosmos after its December 2021 launch, <mark>the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found a shocking surfeit of <strong>bright</strong> galaxies that stretch back to the very early universe</mark>. Imagine visiting a foreign land and finding that many of its toddlers weighed as much as teenagers. You might have questions, too: Is the cause of such large children something in the water, or might it instead be that your grasp of human growth is fundamentally flawed? <mark>Scientists dubbed these relatively older systems ultramassive galaxies and kept scratching their heads: neither set of galaxies could be wholly explained by our current models.</mark></p>
          <p>Investigating some of these early galaxies, several studies now point more toward an astrophysical explanation for the unexpected girth‚Äîsuch as earlier-forming black holes or bursts of star formation‚Äîrather than some physics-shattering result.</p>
          <p>Today in the journal Physical Review Letters, Nashwan Sabti of Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and his colleagues have proposed a solution for JWST's ultramassive galaxies. <mark>Existing data from Hubble's UV observations allowed the researchers to better gauge the rates of star formation</mark>‚Äîthe change in stellar mass over time‚Äî<mark>versus the stellar mass itself from JWST, which primarily observes in infrared</mark>. <mark>Comparing those two pieces of information, Sabti and his colleagues found that the galaxies were growing exactly as expected</mark> in accordance with our cosmological model of the universe: the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Lambda-CDM) model.</p>
          <p>Boylan-Kolchin says the paper makes a ‚Äúgreat point‚Äù in comparing Hubble and JWST data from this period of the universe. He isn't completely convinced just yet, however. ‚ÄúI don't think the case is airtight,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú<mark>The loophole is: you're not necessarily observing the same galaxies with JWST and Hubble.</mark> Galaxies can be luminous [in infrared] for JWST but invisible for Hubble. If the most massive ones happen to be in that [infrared] regime, then maybe Hubble wouldn't be seeing them.‚Äù</p>

    <div class="jarticlebox">
      <p>Nicknamed 'ghost particles,' the elusive neutrinos have been around since the beginning of the universe, appearing in three 'flavors' named for the particle they produce upon interacting with matter: electrons, muons, and taus. The sun serves as a massive nuclear reactor emitting torrents of electron neutrinos, but experiments detected roughly a third as many electron neutrinos radiating from the sun as expected. Some researchers began to suspect that the solar neutrinos were oscillating, or switching flavors, en route to Earth.</p>
      <p><mark>Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald spearheaded giant underground experiments that revealed that individual neutrinos do oscillate from one flavor into another, and that they have mass.</mark></p>
      <blockquote>Kajita and his Super-Kamiokande collaborators focused on detecting muon neutrinos that are produced in the atmosphere when incoming charged particles from space collide with air molecules. The researchers counted up the rare flashes due to neutrino interactions and charted where each neutrino had come from. More muon neutrinos came from above than below, even though they pass unaffected through the Earth. In 1998, the team concluded that the neutrinos from below had enough time during their trek through Earth's interior to change flavors, while the ones from above did not (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ghostlike-particles-carry-little-weight">SN: 6/13/98, p. 374</a>). While Super-Kamiokande produced compelling evidence for neutrino oscillation, the experiment couldn't prove that the total number of neutrinos, regardless of flavor, was consistent.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>In 2001 and 2002, McDonald's team confirmed the scarcity of electron neutrinos from the sun but showed that the shortage disappeared if one took into account neutrinos of all flavors (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-bedrock-cracks-sun-shines">SN: 6/23/01, p. 388</a>).</blockquote>
      <p>These discoveries led to more research on the three neutrino flavors. <mark>A few recent experiments suggest that the oscillation rate of neutrinos may differ from the oscillation rate of anti-neutrinos</mark>, which could help explain why the universe is dominated by matter, even though it probably started out with equal parts matter and anti-matter.</p>

Instead, each region controls different parts at different times.</mark> Their motor neural network seems as flexible as their bodies ‚Äî a phenomenon that expands the range of neurophysiological possibility, and could refine the design of arm-flexing robots.

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>How octopuses control their arms has been a focus of [University of Jerusalem neurobiologist Benny] Hochner's work for more than a decade. In earlier studies, he helped show that seemingly complex movements are actually combinations of individually simple motions. Hochner also found that many of the movements are guided peripherally, rather than by the brain, as if each arm had its own spinal cord.</p>
                    <p>An octopus brain sends a general prompt, and the arm computes the specifics: It's much simpler than running all those calculations in the brain itself. And all this is especially interesting to roboticists who want to build machines with flexible appendages, ideal for rescue bots working in disaster areas or surgical machines weaving through a body.</p>

                  <blockquote><p>"The networks are embedded in one another. The system is remodeled according to stimulation.
