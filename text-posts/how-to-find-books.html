    <h1>How </h1>

    <p>What you need is to get on laptop (not phone) and open Goodreads. You will repeat this process many times, over many days:</p>

    <p>0. If you haven't already, you'll need to add the most salient books to your library, by giving them a star rating or adding them to one of the main shelves. Personally, I've added 2 custom bookshelves to the main shelf group (to-read, reading, and read): did-not-finish and will-not-read.</p>

    <p>1. Look up a book you had strong feelings about (positive,  negative, or mixed)</p>

    <p>2. Look through the comments for people who articulate your feelings about this book WELL. If you hate the writing, look for reviews that describe what it is about the writing that they hated. etc. Pick one of these reviews.</p>


3. Click on the reviewer's profile and go to More -> "Compare Books." This will give you an easy-to-read table of all the books you have in common. You can quickly scan their taste to see if it is broadly similar to yours.

3b. Don't try ope
