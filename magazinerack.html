            <article class="purple">
            <blockquote><p>What do you give away, when you write a book? What piece of yourself are you carving off, I mean? For a writer must treat himself like some sort of grisly compulsive, but mentally. There goes a childhood memory, now severed and served. There goes your first kiss. There goes your first bad break-up. There goes the enigmatic sad smile of your father.</p>
            <p>In my first book, a novel, what I gave away was myself in my twenties, when I was flawed and prideful and angry but also poetic and barely containable. It's the reason the book has an emotionality I'm still proud of, and that I couldn't pull off now. I carved off chunks of personality and distributed them across characters, and after they left I felt quieter. Inside, I mean. But also, more lonely. As a person I was a bit smaller, and simpler.</p></blockquote>    
            <blockquote><p>despite how there is an inexhaustible supply of facts, eventually after many volumes a nonfiction writer has nothing left to give, and so their books get thinner, both physically but also metaphysically‚Äîthey write the book because this is how they make their money, because they know nothing else. Thus the tenth book by a popular nonfiction writer is often some sort of wisp, risking nothing, carving off nothing. Occasionally, an older veteran writer, either of fiction or nonfiction, will overcome the barrier of experience, but only through audacity‚Äîmeaning that the best cut their hearts out in the end.</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p>It is strange to be in the business of hollowing yourself out. You become a peculiar salesman of self, gradually getting smaller each time. But being an author is also, in many ways, a deeply rewarding pursuit. <mark>So here I am, hoping you decide to check out my alien wares, to buy the jewelry I made from my own bones.</mark></p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>[in the opening of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCmlE17iUT0&ab_channel=AwarenessBureau">Into the Abyss</a>] The Reverend is talking about how the Lord works in mysterious ways, and so on‚Äîit is exactly the type of conversation you want to avoid. It is very ChatGPT. It is the Reverend repeating things he&#8217;s said before‚Äîwords that protect him, that allow him to perform the role of Reverend, instead of being what he is: a man named Lopez, who will soon have to watch a boy die.</p>
  
            <p>At one point, the Reverend, as a part of a monologue about the beauty of God&#8217;s creation, mentions that he sometimes meditates on the beauty of the squirrels he sees on the golf course. Herzog, standing in a graveyard with nameless crosses, says, with mad Bavarian seriousness, &#8220;Please describe an encounter with a squirrel.&#8221;</p>
              
            <p>Lopez is a bit surprised by the question, but he takes it in a playful spirit‚Äîhis voice lifts, joyously. He starts to talk faster. (This is where the conversation shifts into the type you want.) He is no longer saying versions of things he has said before, he&#8217;s not protecting himself, he&#8217;s just <em>there</em>.</p>
  
            <p>From that point on, it takes about ten seconds before he&#8217;s crying.</p>
  
            <p>In interviews, Herzog likes to mention this conversation to explain his craft. &#8220;But how on earth did you know to say that?&#8221; says the interviewer. &#8220;Were you just trying to say something unexpected to unbalance him?&#8221; &#8220;No, it was not random&#8221;, Herzog says. &#8220;I knew I had to say those <em>exact</em> words. Because <em>I know the heart of men</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p><mark>If you want to prompt someone to be authentic and playful and generative, you usually just need to ask them something where they have a rich experience to pull from <em>but have never pulled an answer from that experience before</em>. If you ask two or three increasingly detailed questions about something they tell you, you get there.</mark> [...] I tend to find that almost everyone is captivating and loveable when I manage to talk like this.</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <ol>

                <li>You can&#8217;t see it either at first. But if you run enough experiments you get a sense of how that inner space behaves. In particular, <mark>you can figure out which types of people can fuse with your interiority and expand it</mark>.</li>
                <li>You will not be able to <em>explain</em>  this fusion works. So don&#8217;t do it.</li>

        <div class="titlebox">üòã 20230109 <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/eating-and-reading-with-katherine-mansfield">Eating and Reading with Katherine Mansfield</a> - Aim√© Gasston on The Public Domain Review</div>
        <article class="yellow">
            <blockquote>
              <p>Throughout her letters and diaries, Mansfield analogises the act of reading with that of eating, particularly at her most frank, when writing ‚Äúto‚Äù herself in her journal, or to Murry. [...] In 1921, she writes to her cousin, the novelist Elizabeth von Arnim: ‚ÄúI have turned to Milton all last week. There are times when Milton seems the only food to me‚Äù. Elsewhere she articulates the ‚Äúsudden sweet shock‚Äù of delight that Henry James gives her. <mark>In a further letter to Murry, she describes ‚Äúget[ting] up hungry from the french language [because she has] too great an appetite for the real thing to be put off with pretty little kickshaws‚Äù.</mark></p>
              <p>This dissatisfaction, Mansfield's letter concludes, is the result of being spoilt by too much Shakespeare, drawing sharp relief between the ‚Äúrich‚Äù language of English, and the French, which she finds ‚Äúhard to stomach‚Äù. The word ‚Äúkickshaw‚Äù itself derives from French (quelque-chose) and is defined as a ‚Äúfancy but insubstantial cooked dish, especially one of foreign origin‚Äù.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <span class="mynote" style="font-family: 'bad-script'; color: #7030A0;">According to Oxford Reference dot com, kickshaw's first appearance is in Shakespeare's Henry IV Part Two (1597), in which Justice Shallow gives orders to his servant Davy for a meal to be prepared for Falstaff, including 'some pigeons ‚Ä¶, a couple of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny kickshaws'.</span>
            <blockquote><p>In ‚Äú<cite>The Modern Soul</cite>‚Äù, England is described as ‚Äúmerely an island of beef flesh swimming in a warm gulf sea of gravy‚Äù [...] while ‚Äú<cite>At Lehmann's</cite>‚Äù brings us the son of a butcher, ‚Äúa mean, undersized child very much like one of his father's sausages‚Äù, and a pregnant wife who is told to stay away from customers because she looks ‚Äúunappetizing‚Äù.</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p>In the title story, ‚Äú<cite>Bliss</cite>‚Äù, food is everywhere, saturating thought and speech, and even evident in self-consciously avant-garde clothing (nut earrings and dresses like banana skins). The bohemians invited to Bertha's dinner party speak of plays entitled Love in False Teeth and Stomach Trouble, a plan for a fried-fish interior design scheme, and a poem called Table d'H√¥te, which opens with the line: ‚ÄúWhy must it always be tomato soup?‚Äù But this gustatory discourse is unrelated to passion or animal urges [...] The fish will rot, the soup in the poem will go rancid, but there will be another fad to replace it and the guests will have already turned away before they can witness the decay. <mark><cite>Bliss and Other Stories</cite> most often depicts characters too entrapped by metropolitan intellectualism to know how to use their bodies and therefore <em>eat</em>.</mark></p>
            <cite>In The Garden Party</cite> collection, widely considered to contain some of Mansfield's most accomplished work (with the fiction testifying to her pledge to create a kind of ‚Äúspecial prose‚Äù which would pay a ‚Äúsacred debt‚Äù to her homeland [New Zealand]), there is a marked shift.</p></blockquote>

          <p><mark>If the conclusion you take from this story is that you should be Buddhist, you are absolutely missing the point.</mark> The point is that we should experiment with everything and pick what best fits our situation, reverence be damned. There is no reason to believe that traditional Buddhist psychological theory and practice should be given ultimate preference, unless you believe that there have been no new psychological insights or useful tools created in the last millennium. [...] we also certainly have modern neuroses‚Äîbugs in our cultural programming that bear no resemblance to those of the nobility of the Himalayas of yore. Maybe we need some different tools for those. </p></blockquote>

          <blockquote><p>You will obviously run into trouble if you brand yourself as Mentally Perfect in some way. Like, if you‚Äôve become highly invested in the idea that you‚Äôre not supposed to experience mental turbulence anymore, this will naturally cause you to avoid stress and conflict, which could, in turn, cause you to avoid growth, accountability, and humility.</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote><p>I would suggest that if your long-term contemplative life does not demonstrably cash out in some degree of increased behavioral nobility, then what you have is a talent for mental masturbation. And that‚Äôs ultimately not so bad! Some people spend their whole lives fucking other people over. Sitting quietly in private rapture is significantly better than that.

        <article class="blue">
        <blockquote><p>Zaza was Beauvoir's best childhood friend. They met at age nine, when Zaza sat next to Beauvoir at school and grew so close that teachers called them 'the inseparables' [...] by Beauvoir's own admission, her entire philosophy of friendship was shaped by her friendship with Zaza. [...] It is possible, certainly her mother thought so, that Beauvoir edged towards infatuation with Zaza. [...] Nevertheless, Beauvoir also said that 'the kind of love where you kiss' held no meaning for her.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p><mark>Beauvoir wrote that 'for friendship to be authentic, it must first be free.' Of course, there must be some kind of reciprocity in friendship, but how that reciprocity manifests is often lopsided. We tend to lazily think of friendship as symmetrical, when most of the time it isn't - and doesn't need to be, as long as the friendship is based on <u>intersubjectivity</u>. [...] When we understand that we are each subjects for ourselves and objects for others</mark> - in other words, when we freely and reciprocally recognise that other people's lives are as real and vital as our own - then authentic friendship can flourish.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>For Beauvoir, authentic friendship springs from an exalted level of cerebral amity. [...] In <em>The Second Sex</em> (1949), Beauvoir distinguishes between spiritual and carnal desire. <mark>Spiritual desire is the intellectual ecstasy sparked when friends are vulnerable; for example, when they share secrets and diaries, show tenderness, and exchange fervent letters.</mark></p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Sometimes one friend takes advantage of the other and sadistically exploits them, disrupting their intersubjectivity and killing authentic friendship. Beauvoir didn't demand that Zaza feel the same way about her, but then nor did Zaza take advantage of Beauvoir's feelings. Thus authentic friendship could be maintained.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Beauvoir and Zaza were not physically affectionate. They referred to each other with the formal vous, and to other friends with the informal tu. But they were intellectually affectionate. They talked vivaciously about 'adult' things such as justice, Napoleon, travel, and classic books such as Don Quixote (1605-15) by Miguel de Cervantes, and the story of Tristan and Isolde.

The intersubjective message of the novel certainly didn't gel with Sartre's early philosophy. Sartre believed that we can never trust one another beyond doubt, and therefore there is no foundation on which to connect with other people and understand them. [...] Crucially, for Beauvoir, our singularities are a 'metaphysical fact', <b>but</b> '<mark>the tragedy of the unhappy consciousness [arises when] each consciousness seeks to posit itself alone as sovereign subject.</mark>' <b>In a posthumously published notebook, Sartre wrote about the virtue of generosity and defined 'true friendship' as '[c]ombatants who together create a setting of intersubjectivity in their own way.'</b></blockquote>

        <taggies class="yellowtag">#Reviews</taggies>
        <article class="yellow">
        <blockquote><p>I first read <em>Blonde</em> soon after it was published. [...] I came away from the novel thinking Marilyn had been a victim of the studio system and the usual misogyny that by that time I, too, was overly familiar with. Twenty years later, I read Blonde again. [...] Concerned with celebrity culture in America, I'd chosen this enduring icon as the star of my thesis [...]. I'd researched the hell out of her. So, this time reading Blonde, I saw how far Oates strayed from the biography of Marilyn Monroe.</p></blockquote>
        <p>This movie makes up trauma for Marilyn to have gone through and shows nothing of the agency she showed, how she worked on her craft and pushed for recognition to leverage for better deals. How she was determined, funny, and surrounded by loving friends and family.</p>
        <blockquote><p>But does that matter? It's entertainment after all, storytelling.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>I can't help comparing Blonde to another recent film about a famous dead celebrity‚ÄîElvis. [...] Unlike in Blonde, Elvis Presley is multidimensional, nuanced, and human. Sure, Andrew Dominik is no Baz Luhrmann. But I wonder if the fact that Elvis relies on biographical research rather than a novel made it the more successful film for me (and most critics).</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p><mark>Blonde [the novel] is not the story of Marilyn Monroe. However, it is the blueprint for the film. Many of the scenes that have provoked the greatest controversy‚Äîand that veer the furthest from reality‚Äîare straight out of the novel. A novel that was lauded in the early aughts. But in the 22 years between the publication of Blonde and the film's arrival, the world has changed.</mark> We've had Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo. We've had a misogynist in the White House. We've had the strike-down of Roe v. Wade. What may have read as a fictious biography‚Äîor myth-making, as Oates describes her novel‚Äîbecame a film that is a demeaning and vulgar portrait not only of Marilyn Monroe, but of women in general.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p><mark>If copper can kill a tree, why do we believe it is safe to put this same material directly inside our reproductive systems?</mark> Why do we believe that ‚Äúlocal inflammation due to copper ions,‚Äù a spooky process not much studied since the 80s, can ever be fully local, fully contained, fully understood and managed?</p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>I have not had my IUD for fourteen months now. I removed it myself, accidentally in fact, while taking a shower in Detroit and removing my menstrual cup. Suddenly ‚Äî with a strange swoon of pain ‚Äî the coil was in my hands, already oxidizing a bit in the pale light.</p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>Then, over the next weeks, something strange began to happen. There had long been a buzz inside me, a kind of anxious static, and it was suddenly gone. Not quite sadness, not quite fear, the buzz simply cast a heavy pallor over things ‚Äî gave every moment a sense of constriction, of potential loss. Now that it was gone I was experiencing a set of feelings I thought I had relinquished entirely with my youth: simple, blithe feelings, like the pleasure of merely being alive. [...] And then how surprised I felt to notice I had been doing that, as though some old part of me had suddenly woken up from a very long hibernation, shaken but essentially intact. Altered but sincere. It scared me how much better I already felt. I tried not to think about what it all meant.</p><p>Over the next few months I began to sleep less, noticing I could wake from 7.5 or 8 hours of sleep and feel fine. I lost weight, about 30 pounds in total ‚Äî from a combination of concerted dieting and a body that suddenly seemed able to yield to its own transformation. It became easier to plan, to become optimistic about the future. My mental health stabilized in a way that made it easier to care for myself.</p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>I felt rather like a woman whose life had been saved by an exorcism ‚Äî grateful, but unable to speak the truth. Alive, but embarrassed by what had saved her. Indebted to forces mysterious and crude.</p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>I hadn't thought of this for some time, of the copper IUD, or mineral balancing, or any of that ‚Äî in large part because in daily life I try not to think about it all. But recently, I was forced to, because I once again had the symptoms of copper toxicity. Bloated, tired, feeling horrid and very sad, I gained 2-3 pounds over the course of a month in which nothing else had changed. I was reminded because a friend recently came over and commented on my copper cookware, [...] I stopped cooking with them. The feelings went away. Quietly, almost embarrassed that it had worked, I went back to my life, saying nothing, telling nothing, living on the patchwork I had made ‚Äî a patchwork of knowledge systems meant to carry me whole.</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>In asking "What took so long?" the Sapient Paradox is the prehistoric analog of the Fermi Paradox. Instead of: ‚ÄúWhy are we alone in the universe?‚Äù the Sapient Paradox asks: <mark>‚ÄúWhy were we trapped in prehistory [for so long]?‚Äù</mark> And just as the Fermi Paradox implies a Great Filter, the Sapient Paradox implies a Great Trap, a trap in which human society lived for, at minimum, 50,000 years, and, at maximum, something like 200,000 years or even more. [...] Steven Pinker, in <cite>The Better Angels of Our Nature</cite>, discusses a "Hobbesian trap" of mutual warfare between tribes.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>My mother used to quote Eleanor Roosevelt all the time: "Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people."</p>
        <p><mark>A "gossip trap" is when your whole world doesn't exceed Dunbar's number and to organize your society you are forced to discuss mostly people. It is <cite>Mean Girls</cite> (and mean boys), but forever.</mark> And yes, gossip can act as a leveling mechanism and social power has a bunch of positives‚Äîit's the stuff of life, really. But it's a terrible way to organize society. <mark>So perhaps we leveled ourselves into the ground for 90,000 years.</mark> Being in the gossip trap means reputational management imposes such a steep slope you can't climb out of it, and essentially prevents the development of anything interesting, like art or culture or new ideas or new developments or anything at all. Everyone just lives like crabs in a bucket, pulling each other down. All cognitive resources go to reputation management in the group, to being popular, leaving nothing left in the tank for invention or creativity or art or engineering. Again, much like high school.</p>
        
        <p>And this explains why violating the Dunbar number forces you to invent civilization‚Äîat a certain size (possibly a lot larger than the actual Dunbar number) you simply can't organize society using the non-ordinal natural social hierarchy of humans.</p></blockquote>

The hairy tufts springing from your grandfather's ears are there because parts of him are literally devolving into an ancient creature.</p>

In his youth, the author was arrested for discussing socialist literature and sentenced to die by firing squad. Fortunately, he was spared by a last minute pardon from the tsar himself.</p><p>The author's brief encounter with death launched his religious reawakening, turning him from a pragmatist into a spiritualist. In his fiction, Dostoevsky would often recount the terror and despair he had felt while attending his own execution, and posited that the existential dread of this situation alone was more than enough to justify abolishing the death penalty.</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>After serving years of hard labor in Siberia, Dostoevsky returned to Saint Petersburg to found a literary journal with brother Mikhail. Its writers called themselves pochvenniki, men who advocated a common allegiance to and respect for Russia's soil and natural resources.</p><p>Devotion to Russia was accompanied by antipathy, even hostility, toward European countries. Later in life, Dostoevsky traveled through Europe to seek treatment for his epilepsy and to escape creditors. <mark>In letters, he expressed a deeply rooted longing to return home while simultaneously reflecting on the many ways in which European people were spiritually inferior to Russians.</mark></p></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p><mark>He daydreamed of a war between Europe and Russia and felt certain that Russia would win.</mark> The Russian spirit, Dostoevsky wrote in Dresden, will have ‚Äúsuch sacredness that even we are impotent to fathom the whole depth of that force‚Ä¶ nine-tenths of our strength consists just in the fact that <mark>foreigners do not understand and never will understand the depth and power of our unity.‚Äù</mark></p><p>As Hans Kohn mentions in an article from 1945 titled ‚ÄúDostoevsky's Nationalism,‚Äù the author's philosophy of humility and compassion is at odds with the enthusiasm he showed whenever the Russian Empire waged war to expand its territory.

Of course, we can't regard the Iliad as a faithful account of historical events, but there's no question that ancient Greeks saw it as a model for how heroic men should behave.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exaltation of male weeping continued into the Middle Ages, where it appears in historical records, as well as fictional accounts. In chronicles of the period, we find one ambassador repeatedly bursting into tears when addressing Philip the Good, and the entire audience at a peace congress throwing themselves on the ground, sobbing and groaning as they listen to the speeches. In the 11th-century French epic <cite>The Song of Roland</cite>, the poet describes this reaction to the death of the eponymous hero: 'The lords of France are weeping bitter tears,/ And 20,000 faint in their grief and fall.' We can be pretty sure this didn't happen as described, but it's still remarkable that <mark>20,000 knights swooning from grief were considered noble, not ridiculous</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the sobbing male hero wasn't only a Western phenomenon; he appears in Japanese epics as well. <mark>In <cite>The Tale of Heike</cite>, which is often cited as a source for the ideal behaviour of a samurai,</mark> we find men crying demonstratively at every turn. Here's <mark>a typical response to the death of a commander-in-chief: 'Of all who heard, friend or foe, not one but wept until his sleeves were drenched.'</mark>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In medieval romances, we find innumerable instance of knights crying purely because they miss their girlfriends. In Chr√©tien de Troyes' <cite>The Knight of the Cart</cite>, <mark>no less a hero than Lancelot weeps at a brief separation from Guinevere. At another point, he cries on a lady's shoulder at the thought that he won't get to go to a big tournament.</mark> What's more, instead of being disgusted by this snivelling, she's moved to help, and Lancelot gets to go to the tournament after all. <mark>The knights of King Arthur, King Mark, King Everyone are routinely reduced to tears every time they're told a heart-wrenching story.</mark>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>St Jerome's letter to Eustochium has eight separate references to crying; he describes himself as being in ‚Äòfloods of tears‚Äô, ‚Äòdrenched with tears‚Äô, and ends by exhorting worshippers to ‚ÄòNightly wash your bed and water your couch with your tears‚Äô. St Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, describes 175 separate crying episodes in a single 40-page section of his diary.</p>
          <p>Weeping was such a central part of worship that it was written into the rules of monastic orders as a required accompaniment of prayer and repentance. Throughout the medieval era, disapproval of crying is confined to hypocritical tears, which were understood to be common in both men and women. Put another way, until recently, grown men actually forced themselves to cry publicly in the hope of impressing their peers.</p>
          <p>There‚Äôs one glaring exception to this worldwide sobfest. As the medievalist Sif Rikhardsdottir of the University of Iceland notes, Scandinavians maintained a dry-eyed composure through these sobbing centuries. In her Medieval Translations and Cultural Discourse (2012), Rikhardsdottir illustrates this point by citing two versions of a medieval epic in which a boy hero is lost in the woods. The French hero dissolves in self-pitying tears; his Icelandic counterpart stoically admires the scenery and contemplates his next move.</p>

        <blockquote>Outside of Scandinavia, rampant male boo-hooing persisted well into the Early Modern period, and extended to parliamentarians as well as knights and monks.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><mark>But from the 18th through the 20th centuries, the population became increasingly urbanised; soon, people were living in the midst of thousands of strangers. Furthermore, changes in the economy required men to work together in factories and offices where emotional expression and even private conversation were discouraged as time-wasting.</mark> As Tom Lutz writes in Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears (1999), factory managers deliberately trained their workers to suppress emotion with the aim of boosting productivity: ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt want emotions interfering with the smooth running of things.‚Äô</blockquote>

        <article class="orange">
        <blockquote><p>Julian Jaynes' <cite>The Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind</cite> is a brilliant book, with only two minor flaws. First, that it purports to explains the origin of consciousness. And second, that it posits a breakdown of the bicameral mind. I think it's possible to route around these flaws while keeping the thesis otherwise intact. So I'm going to start by reviewing a slightly different book, the one Jaynes should have written.</p></blockquote>
       Theory of mind, how people think of the thought of older cultures, how people translate old works.
       <blockquote><p>a typical translation might use a phrase like ‚ÄúFear filled Agamemnon's mind‚Äù. Wrong! There is no word for ‚Äúmind‚Äù in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, except maybe in the very newest interpolations. The words are things like kardia, noos, phrenes, and thumos, which Jaynes translates as heart, vision/perception, belly, and sympathetic nervous system, respectively. He might translate the sentence about Agamemnon to say something like ‚ÄúQuivering rose in Agamemnon's belly‚Äù. It still means the same thing - Agamemnon is afraid - but it's how you would talk about it if you didn't have an idea of ‚Äúthe mind‚Äù as the place where mental things happened - you would just notice your belly was quivering more. Later, when the Greeks got theory of mind, they repurposed all these terms.</p></blockquote>
       <blockquote><p>Suppose Achilles is overcome with rage and wants to kill Agamemnon. But this would be a terrible [idea]; after [thinking] about it for a while, he [decides] against. If Achilles has no concept of any of the bracketed words, nothing even slightly corresponding to those terms, how does he conceptualize his own actions? Jaynes:</p>
       <blockquote>The response of Achilles begins in his etor, or what I suggest is a cramp in his guts, where he is in conflict, or put into two parts (mermerizo) whether to obey his thumos, the immediate internal sensations of anger, and kill the king, or not. It is only after this vacillating interval of increasing belly sensations and surges of blood, as Achilles is drawing his mighty sword, that the stress has become sufficient to hallucinate the dreadfully gleaming goddess Athene who then takes over control of the action and tells Achilles what to do.</blockquote></blockquote>
       <blockquote><p><mark>As you go about your day, you hear a voice that tells you what to do, praises you for your successes, criticizes you for your failures, and tells you what decisions to make in difficult situations. Modern theory-of-mind tells you that this is your own voice, thinking thoughts. It says this so consistently and convincingly that we never stop to question whether it might be anything else.</mark></p><p><mark>If you don't have theory of mind, what do you do with it?</mark></p></blockquote>
       <blockquote><p><mark>Then, around 1250 BC,</mark> this well-oiled system started to break down. Jaynes blames trade. <mark>Traders were always going into other countries, with different gods. These new countries would be confusing, and the traders' hallucinatory voices wouldn't always know all the answers. And then they would have to negotiate with rival merchants! Here theory of mind becomes a huge advantage</mark> - you need to be able to model what your rival is thinking in order to get the best deal from him. And your rival also wants theory of mind, so he can figure out how to deceive you. Around 1250 BC, trade started picking up, and these considerations became a much bigger deal. Then around 1200 BC, the Bronze Age collapsed.</p></blockquote>
       <blockquote><p>But <mark>as theory of mind spread, the voices of the gods faded. They receded from constant companions, to only appearing in times of stress (the most important decisions) to never appearing at all.</mark> Jaynes interprets basically everything that happened between about 1000 BC and 700 BC as increasingly frantic attempts to bring the gods back or deal with a godless world.</p>
       <p>Now, to be fair, he cites approximately one zillion pieces of literature from this age with the theme ‚Äúthe gods have forsaken us‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat the hell just happened, why aren't there gods anymore?‚Äù As usual, everyone else wimps out and interprets these metaphorically - claiming that this was just a poetic way for the Mesopotamians to express how unlucky they felt during this chaotic time. Jaynes does not think this was a metaphor - for one thing, people have been unlucky forever, but <mark>the 1000 - 750 BC period was a kind of macabre golden age for ‚Äúthe gods have forsaken us‚Äù literature</mark>.</p></blockquote>
       <blockquote><p>So people got desperate. He says this period was the origin of augury and divination. Omens ‚Äúwere probably present in a trivial way‚Äù before this period, but not very important; ‚Äúthere are, for example, no Sumerian omen texts whatsoever‚Äù. But <mark>after about 1000 BC, omens become an international obsession</mark>. [...] And then there are the demons. Early Sumerians didn't really worry about demons. Their religion was very clear that the gods were in charge and demons were impotent. Post 1000 BC, all of this changes. [...] <mark>and angels, and prophets, and</mark> all the other trappings of religion. When the gods spoke to you every day, and you couldn't get rid of them even if you wanted to, angels - a sort of intermediary with the gods - were unnecessary. <b>There was no place for prophets - when everyone is a prophet, nobody is.</b> There wasn't even <mark>prayer</mark>, at least not in a mystical sense - <mark>as Jaynes puts it, ‚Äúschizophrenics do not beg to hear their voices - it is unnecessary - in the few case where this does happen, it is during recovery when the voices are no longer heard with the same frequency.‚Äù</mark>
       </p>
        <p>The Assyrians invented the idea of Heaven. <mark>Previously, Heaven had been unnecessary. You could go visit your god in the local ziggurat, talk to him, ask him for advice. But word went around that gods had retreated to heaven</mark> - some of the stories even use those exact words, blaming the Great Flood or some other cataclysm. The ziggurats shifted from houses for the gods to e-temen-an-ki - pedestals that the gods could descend to from Heaven, should they ever wish to return.</p>
        <p><mark>By 500 BC, the ability to hear the gods was limited to a few prophets, oracles, and poets.</mark> Jaynes is especially interested in this last group - he cites various ancient sources claiming that the poets only transcribe what they hear gods and goddesses sing to them (everyone else wimps out and says this is metaphorical).</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Jaynes ends by referencing one of my favorite ancient texts, Plutarch's <cite>On The Failure Of Oracles</cite>. Plutarch, writing around 100 AD, is not a skeptic. He believes oracles work <em>in theory</em>. But he records a general consensus that they don't work as well as they used to, and that some day soon they will stop working at all.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>The last oracle to fade away was the greatest - Delphi, perched atop a fantastic gorge as if suspended between Heaven and Earth. Jaynes tries to give us an impression of how important it was in its time; important people from all over the classical world would make the pilgrimage there, leave lavish gifts, and ask Apollo for advice on weighty matters. He thinks that the oracle's fame protected it; if a cultural validation is an important ingredient in god-hearing, Delphi had the strongest and best. Its reputation was unimpeachable. Still, in the centuries after Plutarch, its prophecies became rarer and rarer; the Pythia's few divine utterances became separated by more and more incoherent raving. Finally:</p>
        <blockquote>As part of [the Emperor Julian's] personal quest for authorization, he tried to rehabiliate Delphi in AD 363, three years after it had been ransacked by Constantine. Through his remaining priestess, Apollo prophecied that he would never prophesy again. And the prophecy came true.</blockquote></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>if [American Indians, or Zulus, or Greenland Inuit, or Polynesians, or any other human group presumably isolated from second-millennium-BC Assyrians] were perfectly normal conscious people like us, then Jaynes is wrong about everything.</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p><em>Choosing</em> to navigate non-deterministic challenges with imagination is a way to deal with self-actualization before it becomes a problem. Equally, <mark>choosing a non-imaginative path <em>even</em> when an imaginative path opens up is a symptom of the natural fear of self-actualization.

        <blockquote><p>I'll offer a definition: <i>imagination is the ability to create unpredictable new meaning while generating more freedom than you consume.</i></p>
        <p>The experience of being imaginative is simply the experience of being alive to possibilities, in an open-ended way. The experience of seeing many possible meanings and futures in any given fragment of external reality (and not just the ones your shadow has chosen to inhabit).</p>

You feed imagination by being curious about things beyond your own shadow.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>If only you find relief in the creation, it is projection. If only people very similar to you find relief in the creation, it is still projection. If surprising people find surprising sorts of meaning in the creation, it is self-actualization.</p></blockquote>

        <div class="titlebox">üëÄ 20090521 This is Water: Kenyon College commencement speech by David Foster Wallace</div>
        <article class="blue">
        <blockquote>
            <p>if you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don't be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. <mark>Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance</mark>, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.</p>
        </blockquote>
              <blockquote><p>If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I'd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.</p></blockquote>
              <blockquote><p>the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to [grocery] shop [after work in a crowded supermarket].</p></blockquote>
              <blockquote><p>But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she's not usually like this. Maybe she's been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. [...] But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. <mark>It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.</mark></p></blockquote>
              <blockquote><p>Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it.</p><p>This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to worship.</p>
              <p>Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. <mark>There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.</mark> And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship [...] is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.</p></blockquote>
              <blockquote><p><mark>The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness</mark> and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.</p><p><mark>That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.</mark></p></blockquote>
              <blockquote><p>the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:</p><p><em>‚ÄúThis is water.‚Äù</em></p><p><em>‚ÄúThis is water.‚Äù</em></p><p>It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out.</p></blockquote>

            <article class="green">
            <p>Theory: the book is intended as a work of psychology rather than politics.</p>
            <blockquote><p>
              Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> presents a model for the ideal human soul as a city-state ruled by a truly wise, loving and attentive ‚Äúphilosopher king‚Äù. The concept of the ‚Äúphilosopher king‚Äù has been much quoted as Plato's prescription for good government, but in fact the actual text develops the idea only as a metaphor, and never states whether or not Plato or Socrates believe such a state to be possible or desirable in the real world. <mark>The concept of the ‚ÄúPhilosopher King‚Äù describes Plato's (and Socrates's) prescription for being a good person, not being a good government.</mark></p></blockquote>
              <p><mark>The other four less perfect types of government Plato (via Socrates) describes in this extended metaphor are also... personality types.</mark></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>The double level of meaning ‚Äî everything relates to both the city and the soul ‚Äî renders the allegories murky at times, and much of Plato's usually brisk and humorous style gets lost in the dense depths. For newcomers to Plato, I'd recommend instead the <cite>Gorgias</cite>, the <cite>Phaedo</cite>, the <cite>Meno</cite> or the three short works that narrate Socrates' death: <cite>Apology</cite>, <cite>Crito</cite> and <cite>Phaedo</cite>.</p>

                            <blockquote>[Mnesarchus and Parthenis] consulted the Pythian oracle. She told the young couple they would have a son who would change the world. Mnesarchus promptly renamed his wife Pythias, and the lovers dutifully followed the seer's instructions to visit Phoenicia, in what now is Syria, for the baby's birth. They named him Pythagoras</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Not until Pythagoras turned 60 did he begin to settle down, and his thoughts on aging were not those of the typical senior citizen: the great man saw life in four stages. <mark>"Twenty years a boy, 20 years a youth, 20 years a young man and 20 years an old man."</mark></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Historians disagree about what he did [in Croton, a city in southern Italy inhabited mostly by Greeks], but there is general agreement that <mark>Pythagoras combined radiant charisma with a shaman's magnetic charm. He was a teacher of many things, an uptown mystic in a backwater town.</mark> Crotonians flocked to bask in his glamour and soak up his wisdom. Pythagoras also had a "golden thigh," according to many ancient writers, who soberly reported this curious characteristic as if the man's leg literally were made of the metal. This led Crotonians to what they considered a natural conclusion: Pythagoras was either the god Apollo or the son of Apollo. There was no one the great man wouldn't teach -- children, the poor, city elders. To all, he disseminated his beliefs on faith, diet and morality. <mark>He even spoke to women, whom he treated as equals, atypical behavior for a man in those days.</mark></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>With such flourishes, Pythagoras spread his doctrine of strict vegetarianism. According to legends, he had long performed these odd, magical feats. [...] His good fortune continued in Croton whose citizens had built him a school and a temple honoring his patron god, Apollo.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote><mark>The faithful were divided into two ranks -- disciples who lived in a commune, sharing all possessions, and a larger group called "Acousmatics," whose dedication was less consuming. The disciples</mark> lived faithfully in step with their guru. Like Pythagoras, they ate lightly, taking neither meat nor fish. They slept sparingly, drank no alcohol, insisted on monogamy. They <mark>never ate beans because Pythagoras taught that men's souls were inside the beans</mark>. They never traveled the high road, never touched white roosters. They "received from {Pythagoras} laws," Iamblichus says, "as if they were divine precepts, without which they did nothing."</blockquote>
                            <blockquote><mark>This was an age in which old, stable social orders and their trusted religions were breaking down. Society was in ferment. Many people were seeking new values and updated moral guideposts.</mark> Pythagoras's cult had a lot in common with Orphic cults sweeping Greece. These were named for Orpheus, the tragic mythological lover. Orphics preached and practiced a potpourri of science, mysticism and monkish self-control. <mark>Angry Greek men and women were seeking the same salvation through Orphics and Pythagoras's cult that today's malcontents seek in such modern movements as militias and new religions.</mark> Life in that time, according J.B. Bury in his History of Greece, was not like that of the good old days. <mark>Gone were the secure, nuclear households of Homer's age three centuries earlier. In a tumultuous era of increasing political democracy, which many saw as promoting mob rule and social debauchery, new cults such as the Pythagoreans and Orphics offered new creeds by which to live, preaching temperance, communal living and oligarchy, government by an enlightened few. Many people in Pythagoras's day were drawn by hushed whispers about life after death in some kind of nether world, a concept that reached Greeks from Egyptian and Eastern cultures.</mark> Secrecy and mystical traditions were part of the cults' appeal. It gave them an air of enlightenment and revolution. Each group had its own spin. Orphics emphasized transmigration of souls after death into new bodies. Cults dedicated to the god Dionysius preferred frenzied channeling rituals.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>To Pythagoras, numbers were divine, the primary elements of all existence. Individual numbers had magical powers. <mark>Numbers, he said, are "the cause of gods and demons."</mark> Pythagoras started counting with the number 3. One and 2 he considered building blocks for all other numbers, not numbers themselves. "<mark>Opportunity was 7</mark>," modern scholar Ward Rutherford writes in his account of the Pythagoreans' linkage of numbers with even the most abstract notions. <mark>"Justice is 4, masculinity an odd number, femininity an even." Two embodied the female principle, 3 the male and so marriage was 5.</mark> Odd as such thinking may seem today, Pythagoreans developed key concepts that influenced development of modern science. One, for example, was that nature, or reality, at its deepest level is mathematical. <mark>"All is number," Pythagoras taught</mark>, using a formulation surprisingly close to views expressed by Albert Einstein and others: God is a mathematician. But Pythagoreans went a bit further. They claimed that their numerical mysticism could lead to spiritual purification, ultimately uniting souls of individuals with the divine.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Pythagoras established one of the world's first laboratories, where he <mark>tested acoustics by hammering bells of different weights and measuring the pitch of tones they produced. He discovered that musical pitch is related to vibration in string and varies with the string's length. He found musical harmony results from waves in vibrating strings that are precise multiples of one another</mark> -- one wave in the vibrating string being exactly twice or three times the length of another with which it harmonizes. He measured the stars and plotted an Earth-centered solar system. In fact, <mark><strong>he argued that movements of stars and planets produced a form of musical harmony beyond human comprehension</strong></mark> -- the source of the expression "the music of the spheres." But the Pythagoreans did not share their knowledge. Secrecy was maintained with fervor, including knowledge of various geometric forms considered to have divine properties.</blockquote> 
                        <div dir="rtl" class="ar">ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿ™ŸÖÿ©:</div>
                        <blockquote>Like Chicago, Croton soon became a one-star town. Like Michael Jordan, Pythagoras had become omnipotent. He probably was above direct involvement in political frays, but many in his cult were not. As Bury wrote, his adherents turned the order into "an instrument of political power." [...] When Telis, the Sybarite dictator, demanded return of refugees who had fled to Croton, many Crotonians wanted to comply. They had suffered in recent conflicts with other city-states and were not confident about their power. But Pythagoras was defiant and rallied Croton. His disciple, Milo the wrestler, raised an army and attacked Sybaris. Though outnumbered, Milo's troops crushed Sybaris so completely that it virtually disappeared. Suddenly, Croton was a major power in the region. Yet even in victory, bitter dissension remained. Lingering problems with cults festered across the Greek world.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>Problems for Pythagoras came to a head after he had been in Croton about 20 years. A nobleman named Cylon asked to join the Pythagoreans, but he had a reputation as a partier, so Pythagoras balked. Spurned, Cylon rallied the population against Pythagoras and ambushed him at Milo's house. In the clash, the house was burned, and most local Pythagoreans were killed. The Pythagorean school, though, did not fade.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>The demise of Pythagoras has never been clear. Diogenes Laertius reports that he escaped the fire at Milo's, only to come to a bean field, sacred ground. When he refused to cross it, pursuers from Croton caught him and slit his throat. Other reports say he escaped to Metapontum, a Greek-Italian city-state, and died there shortly afterward. Some reports place him last in Delos, consoling a dying teacher. Sightings of Pythagoras, Elvis-like, were reported for years.</blockquote>
