            <p><strong>The second largest bank failure in US history:</strong> 
            <mark>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based bank that had been teetering for weeks, and sold it to JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank.</mark></p>
            <blockquote><p>by coincidence, [First Republic Bank's] demise came days after the Fed published the results of an internal inquiry into the collapse of S.V.B., which it was responsible for regulating.</p></blockquote>
            <p>In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank financial reform. In 2018, Donald Trump rolled back the "crippling Dodd-Frank regulations that are crushing community banks and credit unions nationwide." Even some Democratic senators endorsed this idea: seventeen of them voted for the bill.</p>
            <blockquote><span style="font-family: 'la-belle-aurore';">If a bank grows as quickly as S.V.B. and First Republic did in recent years, it is often a warning sign to regulators</span></blockquote>
            <p>reforms that merit consideration include limiting stock buybacks by banks, clawing back the bonuses of bankers who lead their firms to ruin, and maybe even encouraging the growth of “narrow banks” that invest their depositors&rsquo; money in assets that have little or no interest-rate and credit risk, such as central-bank reserves and short-term Treasury bonds - even though shifting to narrow banking could make it harder for companies to get loans.</p>

    Despite the efforts made, successive plans, and initiatives begun since the 1970s, economic diversity has proven difficult to achieve in the oil exporting countries that <mark>did not adopt sufficient macroeconomic policies to neutralize the fluctuations of oil revenues on the local economy</mark>. As a result, oil sector shocks raise the degree of risk and lead to a disruption of the relationship between the tradable sectors and the non-tradable sector, despite the fact that the nominal exchange rate is fixed with the dollar.
    <blockquote>Government spending is affected by oil revenues up and down, leading to instability of the national economy, and posing risks to long-term private investment.</blockquote>
    <button class="collapsible">Click to show/hide effects of rising and falling oil revenues</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>At the rising oil revenues stage, spending increases greater than the absorptive capacity of the economy, thus raising inflation, wages, and real estate prices. This raises economic costs for producers in tradable  sectors, weakens the competitiveness of the local economy and reduces the attractiveness of the economy to invest in long-term development projects.</p>
    <p>In contrast, in low oil prices period, oil governments resort to one of the following two policies. The first policy is to reduce spending as much as possible. Development sectors, such as health and education, suffer most. These are essential for achieving sustainable development.</p>
    <p>The second policy is to focus on non-oil revenues by raising taxes and fees to maintain the high level of government spending, which has been inflated by oil revenues. This policy inevitably increases the cost of business to the private sector, weakens the purchasing power of an individual's income, reduces real wage, thereby reducing productivity, or the private sector is forced to raise nominal wages to maintain purchasing power to avoid a decline in productivity. In a country like the Kingdom, more than 50% of employees in private sector are non-Saudis, it is expected that higher wages are required to accept employment in the Kingdom. This raises the wage bill and weakens the competitiveness of the private sector. As an economic result of the increased non-oil revenues, aggregate demand will decrease and business performance costs will rise, and the economy begins to seek a new equilibrium point.</p></div>
    <p><mark><span class="saudi header">Recommendation:</span></mark><br>One of the most significant tools to achieve stability, mentioned in the economic literature and proposed by international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is the fiscal rules for fiscal policy. Some of its most important features, are <mark>determination of the mechanism for pricing oil for budgetary purposes, based on historical and future average oil prices for a number of years</mark>, and directing part of the budget surpluses to a budget balance fund, an sovereign wealth fund (long-term) and a local development fund, in addition to determining the percentage of spending for local income and setting ceilings for revenues, as well as public debt. Moreover, tax rates should be fixed during different periods of oil price fluctuations, with the possibility of changing them slightly for fiscal policy purposes.</p>
    <p><mark>Medium-term budgets should be built for 3 years at the sectoral level, according to medium-term development plans</mark>, thus helps to know the trends of government spending, not only for one year, but for 3 years. It will contribute to the ability of the private sector for investment planning with better certainty and lower risk; it is one of the most important drivers of private investment. In order to achieve the desired benefits from fiscal rules, they must be clear and institutionalized, raising investor confidence and contributing to the stability of the economy.</p>
    <p><span class="saudi header">Current Picture:</span><br>One of the most reliable recent initiatives is what the Minister of Finance announced during the Financial Stability Conference in November 2021, organized by the Capital Market Authority (CMA), that the government will adopt fiscal rules to manage the state's fiscal policy and deal with financial surpluses; its details may be announced later. These initiatives may be an important step that contributes to economic diversification.</p>
