    <div><span class="title"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hec.4635">The effect of health financing systems (HFS) on health system outcomes: A cross-country panel analysis</a></span> <span class="subtitle">Jacopo Gabani, Sumit Mazumdar, & Marc Suhrcke on Health Economics (Wiley) - Dec 8, 2022</span></div>
    <hr class="hr2">
    <p>We find that <mark>transitions from out-of-pocket to government-predominant health financing systems resulted in greater immunization coverage, and improved health system outcomes</mark> (life expectancy, under-5 mortality and incidence of catastrophic health expenditure) <mark>than social-health-insurance-predominant HFS</mark>. For the few outcomes where this was not the case, social health insurance and government-predominant HFS showed similar results.</p>
    <p>In this paper, social health insurance financing refers to health expenditures channelled via SHI agencies that require a contribution to access services, irrespective of whether the contribution is subsidized by the government or not.</p>
    <button class="collapsible">Click to show/hide previous research</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Two important but regionally focused studies (on OECD and Eastern European countries) from more than a decade ago concluded that introducing SHI led to no improvement or even to a deterioration of health outcomes, while having increased costs (Wagstaff, 2009a; Wagstaff and Moreno-Serra, 2009a). A common issue in these studies is that a country's HFS, depending on existing laws, could only be classified as either “tax-based” or “SHI”. By allowing only these two classifications, countries financed predominantly by OOP expenditures were (mis-)classified as either tax-based or SHI. In addition, only the effects of transitioning from tax-based to SHI HFS were examined, thus ignoring the potential effects of transitioning from predominantly OOP to either tax-based or SHI HFSs. Another global study found that (proportional) increases in expenditure in contributory SHI and non-contributory government financing are positively correlated with service coverage indicators, but only non-contributory government financing is correlated with improvements in financial risk protection (Wagstaff & Neelsen, 2020). This study investigated the association of HFS with financial risk protection and service coverage but not health status, controlled only for GDP per capita, and most importantly did not investigate transitions from OOP to either SHI or government financing predominant HFS, which is arguably the decision commonly faced by policymakers when contemplating potential paths toward UHC. Other, broadly related studies have investigated the impact of public health expenditure on health system outcomes, mostly finding a positive effect (Nakamura et al., 2016), yet without differentiating public health expenditures into government or SHI financing sources. Finally, a recent systematic review of relevant country case-studies concludes that public health insurance, defined as SHI and community-based health insurance, appears to reduce financial risk protection (Erlangga et al., 2019). However, it is not clear whether this effect is applicable to the entire populations of SHI-countries, or to SHI beneficiaries alone.</p>
        <p>Endogeneity, driven by reverse causality (e.g., as countries with low financial risk protection may be more likely to introduce SHI) and omitted variable bias, is a central challenge in all studies investigating the association between HFS, health expenditure and health system outcomes (Nakamura et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Previous studies that considered public health expenditure as a bundled aggregate, irrespectively of its specific financing nature (Filmer & Pritchett, 1999; Moreno-Serra & Smith, 2015; Nakamura et al., 2016; Rajkumar & Swaroop, 2008), and on studies that did not model transitions from OOP- to SHI- or government-predominant HFSs (Wagstaff, 2009a; Wagstaff & Moreno-Serra, 2009a; Wagstaff & Neelsen, 2020). Multiple contextual factors were neglected in previous SHI-related studies (Wagstaff, 2009a; Wagstaff & Moreno-Serra, 2009a; Wagstaff & Neelsen, 2020).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OOP expenditures increase impoverishment (Xu et al., 2003) and decrease utilization of health services (Qin et al., 2019).</li>
            <li>Higher total health expenditure, especially via increased government financing and decreased OOP expenditure, would translate into more services offered to the population (Qin et al., 2019). Assuming there is demand for the services, the population will use more services than before, and, if those services are of sufficient quality, population health will improve (Moreno-Serra & Smith, 2015).</li>
            <li>Pre-paid pooled expenditures in principle allow the government to deliver cost-effective, preventative health services such as vaccinations, community health, and others, as well as to pool the risks of different individuals together (Moreno-Serra & Smith, 2015). Health equity may also be positively impacted.</li>

    <hr class="hr2">
    Despite the efforts made, successive plans, and initiatives begun since the 1970s, economic diversity has proven difficult to achieve in the oil exporting countries that <mark>did not adopt sufficient macroeconomic policies to neutralize the fluctuations of oil revenues on the local economy</mark>. As a result, oil sector shocks raise the degree of risk and lead to a disruption of the relationship between the tradable sectors and the non-tradable sector, despite the fact that the nominal exchange rate is fixed with the dollar.
    <blockquote>Government spending is affected by oil revenues up and down, leading to instability of the national economy, and posing risks to long-term private investment.</blockquote>
    <button class="collapsible">Click to show/hide effects of rising and falling oil revenues</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>At the rising oil revenues stage, spending increases greater than the absorptive capacity of the economy, thus raising inflation, wages, and real estate prices. This raises economic costs for producers in tradable  sectors, weakens the competitiveness of the local economy and reduces the attractiveness of the economy to invest in long-term development projects.</p>
    <p>In contrast, in low oil prices period, oil governments resort to one of the following two policies. The first policy is to reduce spending as much as possible. Development sectors, such as health and education, suffer most. These are essential for achieving sustainable development.</p>
    <p>The second policy is to focus on non-oil revenues by raising taxes and fees to maintain the high level of government spending, which has been inflated by oil revenues. This policy inevitably increases the cost of business to the private sector, weakens the purchasing power of an individual's income, reduces real wage, thereby reducing productivity, or the private sector is forced to raise nominal wages to maintain purchasing power to avoid a decline in productivity. In a country like the Kingdom, more than 50% of employees in private sector are non-Saudis, it is expected that higher wages are required to accept employment in the Kingdom. This raises the wage bill and weakens the competitiveness of the private sector. As an economic result of the increased non-oil revenues, aggregate demand will decrease and business performance costs will rise, and the economy begins to seek a new equilibrium point.</p></div>
    <p><mark><span class="saudi header">Recommendation:</span></mark><br>One of the most significant tools to achieve stability, mentioned in the economic literature and proposed by international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is the fiscal rules for fiscal policy. Some of its most important features, are <mark>determination of the mechanism for pricing oil for budgetary purposes, based on historical and future average oil prices for a number of years</mark>, and directing part of the budget surpluses to a budget balance fund, an sovereign wealth fund (long-term) and a local development fund, in addition to determining the percentage of spending for local income and setting ceilings for revenues, as well as public debt. Moreover, tax rates should be fixed during different periods of oil price fluctuations, with the possibility of changing them slightly for fiscal policy purposes.</p>
    <p><mark>Medium-term budgets should be built for 3 years at the sectoral level, according to medium-term development plans</mark>, thus helps to know the trends of government spending, not only for one year, but for 3 years. It will contribute to the ability of the private sector for investment planning with better certainty and lower risk; it is one of the most important drivers of private investment. In order to achieve the desired benefits from fiscal rules, they must be clear and institutionalized, raising investor confidence and contributing to the stability of the economy.</p>
    <p><span class="saudi header">Current Picture:</span><br>One of the most reliable recent initiatives is what the Minister of Finance announced during the Financial Stability Conference in November 2021, organized by the Capital Market Authority (CMA), that the government will adopt fiscal rules to manage the state's fiscal policy and deal with financial surpluses; its details may be announced later. These initiatives may be an important step that contributes to economic diversification.</p>

        <hr class="hr2">
        <p><mark>Except for the period 1998-2000, the euro zone has not been achieving <b>Intertemporal Solvency</b></mark> [the discounted value of the sum of future primary budget surpluses (excluding interest payments on the debt) must cover the present public debt - ie, the real growth rate must be higher than the real interest rate.] The public debt, in relation to GDP, is still very high in Italy at nearly 110% and it is close to 60% of GDP in the three other major EMU countries.</p>
        <blockquote>An increasing number of statements - by economists, governments and even from the European Commission - argue that <mark>the euro zone's present fiscal policy rules need to be changed</mark>. Naturally, deciding to change rules as soon as they become a constraint and a nuisance entails the risk of losing credibility. France and Germany may well see their fiscal deficits exceed 4% of GDP in 2003 and 2004. However, in this study, we would like to explore various approaches that could be used to replace the current rules by more sensible ones.</blockquote>

            <ul>
                <li>it does not correct the maximum deficit for the cyclical position of countries, and this shortcoming curtails the counter-cyclical reaction capacity of fiscal policies</li>
                <li>it does not take into account the fact that public debt ratios vary widely among European countries (the condi- tions that ensure intertemporal fiscal solvency are not similar from one country to the next)</li>
                <li>it does not include any objective value for the general public debt ratio, although an excessively high general government debt is what can trigger a mechanism of squeezing-out of private debt</li>
                <li>in contrast with corporate accounting, it sees public investment as operating expenditure, and includes it in the calculation of the fiscal deficit - [This last point is tricky, since one need to know how to define useful and useless government investment. We will not deal with this issue in this study, and our proposals will include the first three points.]</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><mark><span class="header">The Proposal:</span> define an "optimal public debt ratio"</mark> [that meets investors' needs without squeezing out private issuers] <mark>and introduce a constraint on fiscal deficits at the top of the cycle and not at its bottom [to allow for cyclical flexibility</mark> - such an approach forces governments to slash them when growth is strong, and not in cyclical troughs, as this curtails the potential for counter-cyclical policies].</p>
        <blockquote>If one wants to maintain the public debt ratio to 60% of GDP in France, Germany, Spain, with a differential between the real rate interest rate and growth of 2 percentage points, a primary surplus of 1.2 percentage point is necessary. France and Germany do not post such a surplus and should therefore reduce their deficit, while Spain has a higher primary surplus. As Italy's primary surplus is close to 4% of GDP, it reduces its public debt by more than 2.5 percentage points of GDP per year, and therefore is implementing a perfectly suitable fiscal policy.</blockquote>
        <button class="collapsible">Click to show/hide cycle stuff</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Stability Pact sets the constraint of a ceiling of 3% of GDP on the deficit at the bottom of the cycle. But it does not set a constraint on the deficit at the top of the cycle; consequently, the room for manoeuvre between the level of deficit effectively hit at the top of the cycle and the one authorised by the Pact at the bottom of the cycle can be far too small to enable fiscal policy to achieve an efficient counter-cyclical stabilisation via fiscal policy.</p>
            <p>At the top of the cycle in 2000, the fiscal deficit stood at 1.4% of GDP in Germany, with an identical structural deficit; the situation was very similar in France but worse in Italy. Only Spain had wiped out its fiscal deficit at the top of the cycle. All in all, the euro zone had freed 2% of GDP room for manoeuvre in 2000 that is the gap between the limit of 3% and 1% of actual deficit.</p>
            <p>It would have been far more efficient to force countries to balance their budgets or post a budget surplus in 2000 (top of the cycle), and leave them free with respect to the level of their deficit in 2002-2003, with a new constraint stipulating they were to balance their budgets in the next period of high capacity utilisation rates.</p>
