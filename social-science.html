            <p><strong>The second largest bank failure in US history:</strong> 
            <mark>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based bank that had been teetering for weeks, and sold it to JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank.</mark></p>
            <blockquote><p>by coincidence, [First Republic Bank's] demise came days after the Fed published the results of an internal inquiry into the collapse of S.V.B., which it was responsible for regulating.</p></blockquote>
            <p><span class="mynote" style="font-family: la-belle-aurore; font-size: large; line-height: 90%;"></span></p>
            <p>In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank financial reform. In 2018, Donald Trump rolled back the "crippling Dodd-Frank regulations that are crushing community banks and credit unions nationwide." Even some Democratic senators endorsed this idea: seventeen of them voted for the bill.</p>
            <blockquote><span style="font-family: 'la-belle-aurore';">If a bank grows as quickly as S.V.B. and First Republic did in recent years, it is often a warning sign to regulators</span></blockquote>
            <p>reforms that merit consideration include limiting stock buybacks by banks, clawing back the bonuses of bankers who lead their firms to ruin, and maybe even encouraging the growth of “narrow banks” that invest their depositors&rsquo; money in assets that have little or no interest-rate and credit risk, such as central-bank reserves and short-term Treasury bonds - even though shifting to narrow banking could make it harder for companies to get loans.</p>
