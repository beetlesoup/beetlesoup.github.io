          On Mythic Quest, he's a prolific but washed up <em>old</em> sci-fi/fantasy writer who was recruited to work on a video game long, long ago. The (fictional) Nebula award winning story that made his (fictional) career is written exactly how he speaks on the show: like a prolific <s>but washed up</s> old sci-fi/fantasy writer, and I <span class="popup" onclick="wordsAppear()">hate to say<span class="popuptext" id="tota-hatetosay">of course the girl is depicted like that</span></span>

       I loved every word of it. At 28 pages there's not much of a story, but CW's prose is, dare I admit it? beautiful.

  <h2 id="litfic">Literary Fiction</h2>
  I don't know what 'literary' generally means, but here I'm making it mean that the words flow like a river, the sentences are pretty, and it's hard to pick a quote because it's the overall reading experience that is enchanting. Books that are not just about plot & players, but also the poetry of the prose.<br>
